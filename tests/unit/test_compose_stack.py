"""Compose topology properties no running stack can check — ticket E0-02.

Almost every acceptance criterion in E0-02 needs Docker: the stack reaching
healthy, `curl localhost:8000/healthz`, `down -v` then `up -d` twice, and the
API container's `id -u`. Those are the CI `docker` job's job, and the ticket's
definition of done says so plainly — "the health gate in CI is the test". None
of them are restated here.

What is here is the small set of properties that go green in every dynamic
check and are still wrong. There are two kinds:

1.  **Host port publishing belongs to the dev override, not the base file.**
    The definition of done names an exposed port in the base Compose file as a
    security defect, and SPEC §7.2 puts the reverse proxy outside the compose
    file entirely. No dynamic gate can see this: `docker compose up` merges
    `docker-compose.override.yml` automatically, so CI and a developer's laptop
    both exercise the merged topology and never the base file alone. A `ports:`
    entry added to the base file publishes Postgres to the host of every
    non-development deployment and breaks nothing anyone runs.

2.  **Declarations `wait_for_health.sh api` does not reach.** That script fails
    a service that declares no health check, which is why the api health check
    needs no test here. `db` and `redis` are reached only through `api`'s
    `depends_on`, so the conditions on it are load-bearing for the health gate
    covering acceptance criterion 1 at all. In E0-02 the api health check does
    not touch Postgres, so a `depends_on` weakened to the list form passes the
    whole pipeline today and starts mattering silently in E0-04.

A third property used to be asserted here and no longer is: that the dev
override publishes the API on host port 8000. The `docker` job now makes a real
request to `http://localhost:8000/healthz` against the running stack, which
proves the port is published, reachable, and answering. A static assertion about
where the port is declared is strictly weaker than that, and it also pinned a
spelling the ticket left open, so it went when the real check arrived. It was
the paired half of the base-file test above — without it, publishing nothing
anywhere would satisfy that test — and CI now holds that half.

Each test asserts the property rather than a spelling: `expose:` is not
`ports:`, a health check is not a particular command, and `depends_on` as a
plain list is a different thing from `depends_on` with a health condition.
Where Compose allows several spellings of the same property, all of them are
accepted.

The Compose files are parsed in `tests/conftest.py`, unmerged and one at a time,
which is the whole point of items 1 and 2 — `docker compose config` would merge
the override back in and hide both.
