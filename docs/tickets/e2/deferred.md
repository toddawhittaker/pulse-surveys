# E2 — items a ticket deferred rather than fixed

Created by E2-05's PR, per the epic README: a PR that defers something adds it
here in the same PR, and E2-13 runs the cleanup pass over this file. Each entry
names the ticket that owns it and what "done" means, so the deferral is a
scheduled decision rather than a hope.

## Nothing ties an `answer`'s filled column to its question's kind — E2-08

Deferred by E2-05 (PR #140), raised by that PR's security review. The schema
holds exactly one of `rating`, `comment_text`, `workload_hours` per `answer`
row, but nothing pairs *which* one with `question.kind`: a comment question can
hold a rating and a Likert question can hold free text, and the write path is
the only thing that would notice. If the server is to refuse it, the mechanism
E2-05 built for `survey_window` is available and cheap: a `kind` column on
`answer`, `UNIQUE (id, kind)` on `question`, a composite foreign key
`(question_id, kind)`, and a CHECK pairing each kind to its one non-null
column. **Done when** E2-08 either ships that rule or records in its PR body
why write-path validation alone is enough — a decision, not a discovery.

## The unproven structural battery rows — E2-13's boundary review, if ever

E2-05's mutation battery proved the security-relevant schema rules by
migration-side mutation (uniqueness on `response`, both cross-term limbs, the
exactly-one-value CHECK, the absent server defaults, the ordering CHECK) and
two further spot checks, and recorded the remaining structural rows as residue
by mechanism class: model-side mutation is inert here because the test
database builds from the migration, and repeating the same class of mutation
per row buys no new information. **Done when** nothing — this entry exists so
the residue is findable, not to schedule work; a later battery that touches
these tables should mutate the migration, not the model.
