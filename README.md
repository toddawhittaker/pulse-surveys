# Pulse Surveys

An LTI 1.3 / LTI Advantage tool that runs a brief, standardized weekly feedback
cycle in every enrolled course.

1. Students answer five questions each week inside the LMS.
2. Participation credit passes back to the gradebook automatically.
3. Every Monday, instructors get a report: rating distributions, workload data,
   de-identified comments, and an AI-generated summary.
4. Instructors publish a response (with advisory AI coaching); students see the
   aggregate results and that response, which closes the loop.
5. Academic leadership — lead faculty, chair, dean, VPAA — sees roll-up views
   across their span of oversight.

The design goal is trust. Students have to believe their responses are
confidential, and instructors have to believe the data is fair. Most of the
non-obvious requirements in the spec exist to protect one of those two beliefs.

## Status

Early. This repository currently holds the specification, the design brief, and
an exported design prototype. No application code has been written yet.

## Documents

- [`docs/SPEC.md`](docs/SPEC.md) — product and technical specification.
- [`docs/DESIGN_BRIEF.md`](docs/DESIGN_BRIEF.md) — visual and interaction brief.
- [`design/`](design/) — exported prototype components, design tokens, and the
  data model for roles and reporting. This is the visual contract the frontend
  implements.
- [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) — the constraints that must not be violated,
  condensed from the two documents above.

## Deployment model

Single tenant, self-hosted.
